In this file, I collect the tasks I am yet to do on the facial recognition demo.
* finish add face feature
* write docker send function
  there should be two functions: one for the evaluate command, other for the
  retrain command. These functions will do the following:
  + take their arguments from the function call in the interface
  + chain them together in one string
  + send the docker call
* wow
  barely used this file before. Oh well. Here's what I need to do:
** organize GUI buttons in three:
*** evaluate (duh)
*** add face through existing photos
*** add face through camera
** find out budget of centro de valoraci√≥n probatoria
** fix underlying database
*** single "classifier.pkl", "embeddings.npy" and "labels.npy" please
