In this file, I collect the tasks I am yet to do on the facial recognition demo.
* finish add face feature
* write docker send function
  there should be two functions: one for the evaluate command, other for the
  retrain command. These functions will do the following:
  + take their arguments from the function call in the interface
  + chain them together in one string
  + send the docker call
*
